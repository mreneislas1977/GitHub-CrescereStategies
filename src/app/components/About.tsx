<p>
  Our mission is to serve as a catalyst for transformation within the 
  <strong>non-profit and early-stage start-up sectors</strong>. We partner with founders 
  and executive directors to navigate the intricate group dynamics that define 
  their success—balancing the needs of board members, funders, and staff.
</p>
<p>
  We specialize in the "human architecture" of growth. Whether you are managing 
  donor expectations or aligning a founding team, we provide the strategic 
  navigation necessary to turn organizational friction into momentum.
